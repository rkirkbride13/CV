After five years working in a civil engineering consultancy I wanted to give myself a new challenge and as a person who is a strong logical thinker, software development was very attractive. I really enjoy the processes involved, such as problem solving and building products, and I felt I had transferable skills to bring with me. I am currently part way through the 12 week Makers Academy coding bootcamp. 

I am an enthusiastic and gregarious individual looking to bring my technical stengths and personable character to a junior developer role.

## Experience

**COWI UK, London** (January 2018 to October 2022)  
*Engineering consultant*

- Supporting the design of multiple and concurrent civil engineering projects across the UK and abroad.
- Project management with responsibility to supervise team, lead client communication and ensure adherence of quality assurance processes.
- Founding member of the "Early Careers Network"; an interal network spanning all UK offices that created a SharePoint page to facilitate Chartership progress and organised social/technical events, culminating in a 2 night Conference in the Peak District

**COWI UK, London** (2015 & 2016)  
*Summer Intern*

## Skills

#### Initiative
In order to develop my less technical skills during my time at COWI, I reached out the Head of Business Developement to request exposure to the discipline. This lead to periodic recurring catch ups with similarly enthusiastic peers and sit downs with other key players in the companys BD department.

#### Team player
During my time at COWI I was able to support my project manager whilst managing a project of my own

#### Excellent communicator
My time as an engineering consultant helped me hone my abilities for writing about technical content, with design reports/specifications moulded to each Client depending on their technical competencies/preferences. I have also developed my skills for writing more creative content by blogging about my coding journey. My background in engineering has also nutured my ability to explain probelms in a methodical and concise fashion.

#### Additional skills
- Basic French

## Education

**Makers Academy** (November 2022 to February 2023)

A 16 week intensive coding bootcamp where I honed skills such as:
- Object-oriented design
- Test driven development
- Probelm solving
- Independent learning
- Pair programming skills

Languages and frameworks:
- JavaScript, Node.js, Jest
- Ruby, Sinatra, RSPEC
- SQL, PostgreSQL
- HTML, CSS

**University of Bristol** (September 2013 to July 2017)

Civil and Structural Engineering (MEng) with First Class honors

**Marlborough College** (September 2007 to July 2012)

A Levels: Mathematics (A*), Further Mathematics (A), French (A) and Physics (B)

## Hobbies

- **Sports** : I love playing football and having a general run around outside. I have also completed two half marathons and I'm currently (regretfully?) training for the Brighton marathon on 3rd April 2023.
- **Natural history** : I'm never more zen than when watching a David Attenborough documentary. Whenever I go abroad I love keeping half an eye out for any exotic plants/animals, so don't be offened if I accidentally ignore you, there's just a cool lizard over there.
- **Travel** : I love experiencing other foods, drinks and cultures from around the World. I was lucky enough to sandwich my 4 years at univeristy between 3 month stints in Southeast Asia and South America. A personal highlight was a 5 day unaided trek through the Peruvian alps, which highlights my willingness to step out of a comfort zone.
