After five years working in a civil engineering consultancy specialising in bridge design I decided to take on a new challenge and become a Software Developer. Having had the opportunity to apply my skills in the construction industry, I felt I could be more influential in another field and with a fascination in tech and a transferable skillset I decided to change career. In February 2023 I completed the 16 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy and turned this goal into a reality. I love the process of seeing my projects come to life and the endless possibilities of what I will be able to create in this career.

I am an ambitious and gregarious individual looking to bring my technical strengths and personable character to a junior developer role, as well as the leadership skills I forged in my previous roles. In addition to the technologies listed below, I am experienced in working practices such as OOP, TDD, Agile and Version Control.

**Tech skills**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Jest, Cypress, RSpec, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, JWT, GitHub, Trello

## Projects

Check out my [portfolio](https://robbiekbride-co-uk.onrender.com/).

| Name               | Description                                 | Technologies      | Testing
| -------------------| --------------------------------------------| ----------------- |----------
| **[Ecoliday](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/Ecoliday)**  | A travel app to enable people to make a more environmentally informed decision when planning a holiday. It provides users with estimated CO2e emissions for different destinations and vehicle types as well as suggesting local alternatives. Use [this link](https://ecoliday-cxyz.onrender.com/) to try it for yourself!                           | MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, JWT, Tailwind | Jest, Cypress
| **[frontleft](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/frontleft)**  | After Makers, I wanted to build something using TypeScript having learned it after graduating. I settled on frontleft, a music festival act planner to help you see all your favourite artists and DJs and get your monies worth.                           | TypeScript, MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, JWT, CSS | Jest
| **[Acebook](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/acebook-mern)**      | A social media platform built during a two week group project. This was my first introduction to the MERN stack. We were given an existing codebase to initially understand and then to add features to.                               | MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, JWT, CSS | Jest, Cypress              |
| **[Till](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/tech-tests/tree/main/till)**        | An app that replicates the logic of a till, where items from a menu can be added to an order and a receipt be printed.                                  | JavaScript, HTML, CSS | Jest
| **[Bowling](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/bowling-challenge-ruby)**        | A bowling scorecard app where the user inputs each turn and their score is calculated. The surprisingly complex logic of bowling makes such an app a great candidate for writing well planned and test-driven code.                                    | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS | RSpec



## Experience

**[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), London** (October 2022 to February 2023)

A 16 week intensive coding bootcamp where I honed skills such as:
- Object-oriented programming. I practiced and developed my knowledge on encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.
- Test driven development. I used it to ensure my code is robust, reliable and adaptable.
- Agile methodologies. I was able to work in teams to quickly create solutions which could be iteratively improved upon.
- Problem solving and debugging. I was able to break problems down into manageable parts and take a methodical approach to overcome them step by step.
- Independent learning. I used a number of resources including peers, online communities and documentation to quickly address gaps in my knowledge.
- Pair programming. I developed my soft skills, regularly checking in with a partner before each session to gauge how it should run and tailor sessions accordingly.

**[COWI UK](https://www.cowi.com/), London** (January 2018 to October 2022)  
*Engineering consultant*

- Supported the design of multiple and concurrent civil engineering projects across the UK and abroad. During design of the [Mumbai Trans Harbour Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Trans_Harbour_Link) I led the fatigue analysis and created Finite Element Analysis models. 
- When designing the replacement of [Bilsdale Mast](https://www.bilsdalemast.co.uk/) I worked on a two person team under intense time pressure, yet delivered a design with approximately a third less CO2e than the original.
- Project manager of a long-standing Client with responsibility to supervise team, lead client communication and ensure adherence of quality assurance processes. 
- Used my leadership and guidance to support recent graduates when undertaking design calculations and writing reports.
- Founding member of the "Early Careers Network" (ECN); an internal network spanning all UK offices that created a dedicated resource to facilitate Chartership progression in the company and organised social and technical events
- This culminated in a 2 night Conference in the Peak District with approximately 70 guests from 7 different offices. I organised speakers, using my connections in the company, and catering.

**COWI UK, London** (2015 & 2016)  
*Summer Intern*

- Undertook design calculations for several complex bridges, including the proposed [Garden Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Bridge)
- Responsible for the improvement of existing Finite Element Analysis models, including refining mesh densities to increase accuracy and reduce run times.

## Skills

#### Initiative taker
In order to develop my less technical skills whilst at COWI, I reached out to the Head of Business Development to request exposure to the discipline. This led to recurring catch ups and meetings with other key players in the company's Business Development department to learn about their roles and the companies strategies, with the resulting networking paying dividends for my vice-chair role in the ECN. During the Acebook group project at Makers, I regularly initiated communication and decision making to ensure progression by volunteering to lead the group during stand-ups and retros.  

#### Team player
During my time at COWI I was able to unburden my project managers with some of their responsibilities whilst also managing projects and work of my own, a trait which my project manager commended upon my leaving. I bring enthusiasm to group work and am able to energise others to help maintain momentum and achieve success. I signed up to the mentor scheme at Makers and had regular catch-ups with a student in the cohort below to ease any anxieties and answer any questions they had.

#### Excellent communicator
My time as an engineering consultant helped me hone my abilities to write about technical content with design reports and/or specifications molded to each Client, depending on their technical competencies or preferences. I have also developed my skills for writing more creative content by [blogging](https://medium.com/@robbie_kirkbride) about my coding journey. My background in engineering has also nurtured my ability to explain problems in a methodical and concise fashion. For example, I was able to explain to a peer how I had enabled sessions in Sinatra when they reviewed my code for a Twitter clone app.

#### Analytical thinker
During the Makers course I developed a strong debugging process by taking a systematic approach in order to quickly gain knowledge of an error and inform the decisions used to fix it. This was exercised regularly in full stack projects to understand how/if the front and back-end of the app were interacting and zero in on where a bug was being introduced. This trait was exercised regularly at COWI as I often worked with existing structures, for which innovative solutions were required due to the (sometimes literally!) set in stone constraints.   

#### Additional skills
- Basic French

## Hobbies

- :earth_americas: **Travel** : I love experiencing other foods, drinks and cultures from around the World. I was lucky enough to sandwich my 4 years at university between 3 month stints in Southeast Asia and South America. A personal highlight was a 5 day unaided trek (reaching 4,750m altitude) through the [Cordillera Blanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Blanca), which emphasises my willingness to be challenged.
- :soccer: **Sports** : I love playing football and having a general run around outside. I regularly compete in a 5 aside football team and have completed two half marathons, with a third planned for April 2nd.
- :lizard: **Natural history** : I'm never more zen than when watching a David Attenborough documentary. Whenever I go abroad I love keeping half an eye out for any exotic plants/animals, so don't be offened if I accidentally ignore you, there's just a cool lizard over there.
