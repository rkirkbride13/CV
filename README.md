After five years working in a civil engineering consultancy specialising in bridge design I decided to take on a new challenge and become a Software Developer. Having had the opportunity to apply my skills in the construction industry, I challenged myself to be influential in a new field and with a fascination in tech and a transferable skillset I decided to change career. In February 2023 I completed the 16 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy and turned this goal into a reality. I love the process of seeing my projects come to life and the endless possibilities of what I will be able to create in this career.

I am an ambitious and gregarious individual looking to bring my technical strengths and personable character to a developer role, along with the leadership skills I forged in my previous career. In addition to the technologies listed below, I am experienced in working practices such as OOP, TDD, Agile, Version Control and CI/CD pipelines.

**Tech skills**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Jest, Cypress, RSpec, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, JWT, GitHub, Trello

| **[frontleft](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/frontleft)**  | After Makers, I wanted to build something using TypeScript having learned it after graduating. I settled on frontleft, a music festival act planner to help you see all your favourite artists and DJs and get your monies worth. I implemented both test-driven development and CI/CD pipelines and myslef and several friends successfully used it at Glastonbury this year!

| **[Bowling](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/bowling-challenge-ruby)**        | A bowling scorecard app where the user inputs each turn and their score is calculated. The surprisingly complex logic of bowling makes such an app a great candidate for writing well planned and test-driven code.                                    | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS | RSpec



## Experience

**[Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), London** (October 2022 to February 2023)

A 16 week intensive coding bootcamp where I honed skills such as:
- Object-oriented programming. I practiced and developed my skills on writing code with encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism as well as the principles such as DRY and SOLID.
- Test driven development. I possess expertise in writing comprehensive unit tests, mocking to ensure that each component of my code functions properly in isolation as well as within a larger system. 
- Agile methodologies. I used my pragmatic approach to tailor MVPs and ensure that a product was iteratively improved upon and remained functional at the end of each sprint. I used my emotional intelligence to lead standups and retros throughout the Makers course.
- Problem solving and debugging. I was able to break problems down and take a methodical approach to overcome them step by step, using tools such as discovery debugging to both understand codebases and overcome bugs.
- Independent learning. I adopted a growth mindset and used a number of resources including my peers, online communities and documentation to quickly address gaps in my knowledge and build robust systems for future self-directed learning.
- Pair programming. I developed my soft skills, regularly checking in with a partner before each session to gauge how it should run and tailor sessions accordingly. I also used these sessions to share knowledge and ideas.

**[COWI UK](https://www.cowi.com/), London** (January 2018 to October 2022)  
*Engineering consultant*

- Supported the design of multiple and concurrent civil engineering projects across the UK and abroad. During design of the [Mumbai Trans Harbour Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Trans_Harbour_Link) I led the fatigue analysis and created Finite Element Analysis models. 
- When designing the replacement of [Bilsdale Mast](https://www.bilsdalemast.co.uk/) I worked on a two person team under intense time pressure, yet delivered a design with approximately a third less CO2e than the original.
- Project manager of a long-standing Client with responsibility to supervise team, lead client communication and ensure adherence of quality assurance processes. 
- Used my leadership and guidance to support recent graduates when undertaking design calculations and writing reports.
- Founding member of the "Early Careers Network" (ECN); an internal network spanning all UK offices that created a dedicated resource to facilitate Chartership progression in the company and organised social and technical events.
- This culminated in a 2 night Conference in the Peak District with approximately 70 guests from 7 different offices. I organised speakers, using my connections in the company, and catering.

**COWI UK, London** (2015 & 2016)  
*Summer Intern*

- Undertook design calculations for several complex bridges, including the proposed [Garden Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Bridge)
- Responsible for the improvement of existing Finite Element Analysis models, including refining mesh densities to increase accuracy and reduce run times.

## Skills

#### Initiative taker
In order to develop my less technical skills whilst at COWI, I reached out to the Head of Business Development to request exposure to the discipline. This led to recurring catch ups and meetings with other key players in the company's Business Development department to learn about their roles and the companies strategies, with the resulting networking paying dividends for my vice-chair role in the ECN. During the Acebook group project at Makers, I regularly initiated communication and decision making to ensure progression by volunteering to lead the group during stand-ups and retros. I have also taken the initiative to continue my learning since graduating Makers by learning TypeScript and delving further into software development best-practices such as implementing CI/CD pipelines.

#### Team player
I am a team player who is committed to creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas and supporting each other. During my time at COWI I was able to unburden my project managers with some of their responsibilities whilst also managing projects and work of my own, a trait which my project manager commended upon my leaving. I bring enthusiasm to group work and am able to energise others to help maintain momentum and achieve success. I signed up to the mentor scheme at Makers and had regular catch-ups with a student in the cohort below to ease any anxieties and answer any questions they had.

#### Excellent communicator
My time as an engineering consultant helped me hone my abilities to write about technical content with design reports and/or specifications adapted to each Client, depending on their technical competencies or preferences. I have also developed my skills for writing more creative content by [blogging](https://medium.com/@robbie_kirkbride) about my coding journey. My background in engineering has also nurtured my ability to explain problems in a methodical and concise fashion, whether it’s explaining cookies to my mum or explaining to peers how a token checker function could be used as backend middleware to handle HTTP requests, protect endpoints, and facilitate downstream operations.

#### Analytical thinker
Throughout Makers I married my strong analytical thinking with a positive attitude. The second group project was to extend an existing codebase for a social media app built with the MERN stack, which I had no prior experience of. I used discovery debugging to log messages/data to the browser/console to help me understand how the frontend and backend interacted and the sequence the code was running. This enabled me to get to grips with the stack quickly and I eagerly shared my findings with the team. This trait was exercised regularly at COWI as I often worked with existing structures, for which innovative solutions were required due to the (sometimes literally!) set in stone constraints.   

#### Additional skills
- Basic French

## Hobbies

- :earth_americas: **Travel** : I love experiencing other foods, drinks and cultures from around the World. I was lucky enough to sandwich my 4 years at university between 3 month stints in Southeast Asia and South America. A personal highlight was a 5 day unaided trek (reaching 4,750m altitude) through the [Cordillera Blanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordillera_Blanca), which emphasises my willingness to be challenged.
- :soccer: **Sports** : I love playing football and having a general run around outside. I regularly compete in a 5 aside football team and have completed two half marathons, with a third planned for April 2nd.
- :lizard: **Natural history** : I'm never more zen than when watching a David Attenborough documentary. Whenever I go abroad I love keeping half an eye out for any exotic plants/animals, so don't be offened if I accidentally ignore you, there's just a cool lizard over there.
