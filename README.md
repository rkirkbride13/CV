After five years working in a civil engineering consultancy specialising in bridge design, I decided to take on a new challenge and become a Full Stack Junior Developer. Having had the opportunity to apply my skills in the construction industry, I felt I could be more influential in another field and with a fascination in tech and a transferable skillset I decided to change career. In February 2023 I completed the 16 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy and turned this goal into a reality. In addition to the technologies listed below, I am experienced in working practices such as OOP, TDD, Agile and Version Control.

I am an ambitious and gregarious individual looking to bring my technical strengths and personable character to a junior developer role, as well as the leadership skills I forged in my previous roles. 

**Tech skills**: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Jest, Cypress, RSpec, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

## Projects

| Name               | Description                                 | Technologies      | Testing
| -------------------| --------------------------------------------| ----------------- |----------
| **[Ecoliday](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/Ecoliday)**  | A travel app to enable people to make a more environmentally informed decision when planning a holiday. It provides users with estimated CO2e emissions for different destinations and vehicle types as well as suggesting local alternatives.                           | MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, JWT, Tailwind | Jest, Cypress
| **[Acebook](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/acebook-mern)**      | A social media platform built during a two week group project. This was my first introduction to the MERN stack. We were given an existing codebase to initially understand and then to add features to.                               | MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, JWT, CSS | Jest, Cypress              |
| **[Till](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/tech-tests/tree/main/till)**        | An app that replicates the logic of a till, where items from a menu can be added to an order and a receipt be printed.                                  | JavaScript, HTML, CSS | Jest
| **[Bowling](https://github.com/rkirkbride13/bowling-challenge-ruby)**        | A bowling scorecard app where the user inputs each turn and their score is calculated. The surprisingly complex logic of bowling makes such an app a great candidate for writing well planned and test-driven code.                                    | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS | RSpec


## Experience

**[COWI UK](https://www.cowi.com/), London** (January 2018 to October 2022)  
*Engineering consultant*

- Supported the design of multiple and concurrent civil engineering projects across the UK and abroad. During design of the [Mumbai Trans Harbour Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Trans_Harbour_Link) I lead the fatigue analysis and created Finite Element Analysis models. When designing the replacement of [Bilsdale Mast](https://www.bilsdalemast.co.uk/) I worked on a two person team under intense time pressure, yet delivered a design with approximately a third less CO2e than the original.
- Project manager of a long-standing Client with responsibility to supervise team, lead client communication and ensure adherence of quality assurance processes. The team composed of recent graduates who required training and leadership.
- Founding member of the "Early Careers Network" (ECN); an interal network spanning all UK offices that created a SharePoint page to facilitate Chartership progression in the company and organised social and technical events, culminating in a 2 night Conference in the Peak District.

**COWI UK, London** (2015 & 2016)  
*Summer Intern*

## Skills

#### Initiative taker
In order to develop my less technical skills whilst at COWI, I reached out the Head of Business Developement to request exposure to the discipline. This lead to recurring catch ups and meetings with other key players in the companys Business Development department to learn about their roles and the companies strategies, with the resulting networking paying dividends for my vice-chair role in the ECN. During a 7-person group project at Makers, I regularly initiated communication and decision making to ensure progression.  

#### Team player
During my time at COWI I was able to unburden my project managers with some of their responsibilities whilst also managing projects and work of my own, a trait which my project manager commended upon my leaving. I bring enthusiasm to group work and am able to energise others to help maintain momentum and achieve success. I signed up to the mentor scheme at Makers and had regular catch-ups with a student in the cohort below to ease any anxieties and answer any questions they had.

#### Excellent communicator
My time as an engineering consultant helped me hone my abilities to write about technical content with design reports and/or specifications moulded to each Client, depending on their technical competencies or preferences. I have also developed my skills for writing more creative content by blogging about my coding journey, as seen in the link at the top of the page. My background in engineering has also nutured my ability to explain problems in a methodical and concise fashion.

#### Analytical thinker
During the Makers course I developed a strong debugging process by taking a systematic approach in order to quickly gain knowledge of an error and inform the decisions used to fix it. This was exercised regularly in full stack projects to understand how/if the front and back-end of the app were interacting and zero in on where a bug was being introduced. This trait was exercised regularly at COWI as I often worked with existing structures, for which innovative solutions were required due to the (sometimes literally!) set in stone constraints.   

#### Additional skills
- Basic French

## Education

**Makers Academy** (November 2022 to February 2023)

A 16 week intensive coding bootcamp where I honed skills involving:
- Object-oriented programming
- Test driven development
- Agile methodologies
- Probelm solving
- Independent learning
- Pair programming skills

**University of Bristol** (September 2013 to July 2017)

Civil and Structural Engineering (MEng) with First Class honors

**Marlborough College** (September 2007 to July 2012)

A Levels: Mathematics (A*), Further Mathematics (A), French (A) and Physics (B)

## Hobbies

- :soccer: **Sports** : I love playing football and having a general run around outside. I regularly compete in a 5 aside football team and have completed two half marathons.
- :lizard: **Natural history** : I'm never more zen than when watching a David Attenborough documentary. Whenever I go abroad I love keeping half an eye out for any exotic plants/animals, so don't be offened if I accidentally ignore you, there's just a cool lizard over there.
- :earth_americas: **Travel** : I love experiencing other foods, drinks and cultures from around the World. I was lucky enough to sandwich my 4 years at univeristy between 3 month stints in Southeast Asia and South America. A personal highlight was a 5 day unaided trek (reaching 4,750m altitude) through the Cordillera Blanca, which highlights my willingness to take on a challenge.
