After five years working in a civil engineering consultancy specialising in bridge design, I decided to take on a new challenge and become a Full Stack Junior Developer. In February 2023 I completed the 16 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy where I learned a wide range of technologies and practices, and turned this goal into a reality.

I am an ambitious and gregarious individual looking to bring my technical strengths and personable character to a junior developer role, as well as the leadership skills I forged in my previous roles.

Tech skills: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Jest, Cypress, RSpec, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

## Experience

**COWI UK, London** (January 2018 to October 2022)  
*Engineering consultant*

- Supported the design of multiple and concurrent civil engineering projects across the UK and abroad.
- Project management with responsibility to supervise team, lead client communication and ensure adherence of quality assurance processes.
- Founding member of the "Early Careers Network" (ECN); an interal network spanning all UK offices that created a SharePoint page to facilitate Chartership progress and organised social/technical events, culminating in a 2 night Conference in the Peak District

**COWI UK, London** (2015 & 2016)  
*Summer Intern*

## Skills

#### Initiative
In order to develop my less technical skills whilst at COWI, I reached out the Head of Business Developement to request exposure to the discipline. This lead to recurring catch ups with similarly enthusiastic peers and sit downs with other key players in the companys Business Development department to learn about their roles and the companies strategies, with the resulting networking paying dividends for my role in the ECN.

#### Team player
During my time at COWI I was able to unburden my project managers with some of their responsibilities whilst also managing projects and work of my own. My final project manager commended this trait on my leaving. I bring enthusiasm to group work and am able to energise others to help maintain momentum and achieve success.

#### Excellent communicator
My time as an engineering consultant helped me hone my abilities to write about technical content, with design reports and/or specifications moulded to each Client, depending on their technical competencies or preferences. I have also developed my skills for writing more creative content by blogging about my coding journey. My background in engineering has also nutured my ability to explain probelms in a methodical and concise fashion.

#### Additional skills
- Basic French

## Education

**Makers Academy** (November 2022 to February 2023)

A 16 week intensive coding bootcamp where I honed skills involving:
- Object-oriented programming
- Test driven development
- Agile methodologies
- Probelm solving
- Independent learning
- Pair programming skills

**University of Bristol** (September 2013 to July 2017)

Civil and Structural Engineering (MEng) with First Class honors

**Marlborough College** (September 2007 to July 2012)

A Levels: Mathematics (A*), Further Mathematics (A), French (A) and Physics (B)

## Hobbies

- **Sports** : I love playing football and having a general run around outside. I regularly compete in a 5 aside football team and have completed two half marathons.
- **Natural history** : I'm never more zen than when watching a David Attenborough documentary. Whenever I go abroad I love keeping half an eye out for any exotic plants/animals, so don't be offened if I accidentally ignore you, there's just a cool lizard over there.
- **Travel** : I love experiencing other foods, drinks and cultures from around the World. I was lucky enough to sandwich my 4 years at univeristy between 3 month stints in Southeast Asia and South America. A personal highlight was a 5 day unaided trek through the Peruvian alps, which highlights my willingness to step out of my comfort zone.
